# SEZIN

**Slogan:** *Fill Your City*

## Description
SEZIN is a **map-first mobile app** designed to let people share their daily feelings directly on the city map where they are located. Users can post emotions **anonymously or non-anonymously**, creating a living, emotional map of their city.  

Other users can explore the city map, filter by areas or emotions, and react to posts, making the city feel more **vivid, emotional, and wholesome**. Emotions live only **24 hours** and then disappear — ensuring privacy and spontaneity.  

The app is **not focused on fame or public recognition**; it encourages authentic daily emotional expression in a safe, ephemeral way.
